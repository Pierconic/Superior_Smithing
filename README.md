Admittedly the templates were added AFTER vanilla smithing was announced, but this is still the better system. Each template is associated with a specific material, which grants specific benefits and drawbacks. Iron increases power at the expense of speed, gold increases efficency at the expense of durability, etc. Templates can be duplicated, but not indefinitely, and cannot be duplicated from copies, such that templates could actually have an interesting economy in a multiplayer setting. Various special templates grant especially unbalanced effects, and templates can be applied to tools/weapons as well as armor. Also adds a handful of enchantments, and improves monster equipment, for good measure.
